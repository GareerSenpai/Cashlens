🔴 fix the role in user so that one user can have multiple roles.

✔️ fix the page query param on search params on the client side so that a change in page won't trigger an api call as we are not doing backend pagination

🔴 fix colors, fonts, and other stylings

🔴 make the site responsive

✔️ fix the security issue in role so that even if the user tries to send a role, it won't be accepted.
(DONE using @JsonProperty(access = JsonProperty.Access.READ_ONLY) // field is returned in responses but ignored in requests)
(can be done by using DTOs - https://chatgpt.com/share/68c2d1d8-fb94-8003-8765-7cd1e260d5e0)

🔴 bindingResult on server side.

🔴 every time, we are calculating total expense and total income. If we can store them in the User table for instance, then we can directly query it... (see the last section in this - https://chatgpt.com/share/68c3e969-bed0-8003-9bf6-f29e56306ceb)

✔️ ADD DUMMY DATA IN SQL: (DONE)

INSERT INTO Expense (id, user_id, amount, category, icon, description, payment_method, expense_date, created_at)

  SELECT 1 AS n
  UNION ALL
  SELECT n + 1 FROM seq WHERE n < 50
)
SELECT 
    UUID(),
    'e3d959fe-b80b-46a8-9334-223119b5b249',
    ROUND(RAND() * 1000 + 50, 2),
    cat.category,
    cat.icon,
    CONCAT('Auto-generated ', cat.category, ' expense'),
    ELT(FLOOR(1 + RAND() * 4), 'Cash','Card','UPI','Bank Transfer'),
